		<h5>It was 11th of March, 2015, a day before the result of Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) 2015. I had prepared very hard for the exam and was hoping a glorious rank that would land me into Structural Engineering department of any top IIT. I had all my plans well set: M.Tech for two years, prepare for I.E.S. in the meanwhile, crack I.E.S. and become a Government officer in Indian Railways. 

At 10 PM, my phone rang. A friend called to tell me the results were out and I couldn't hear after that. I typed my roll number in the website with shivering fingers, only to find out I couldn't crack the exam.

I was shattered. I started mourning at the highest of my pitch that very moment. I could see all my dreams broken in front of my eyes. It was all over for me. I didn't leave my room for the next three days. I cried for two weeks almost all the time. I was sobbing in the classroom, in the movie theater, everywhere. It took me 20 days to question myself whether I really wanted this. And strangely, the answer was NO.

I figured out, how I had spent 23 years of my life following others and doing all what the world had been doing. Everybody was taking P.C.M. after 10th standard, everyone was preparing for IITJEE, and then in college, everyone was preparing fro GATE. So all this time, I was all like, " Hey! I too should do this, like everybody else." I was going through tremendous emotional turbulence then and it was getting really tough to sort out everything. It was time to do something I wanted.

During that time, I was in regular contact with the team WittyFeed, and had been offered a job to work as a content writer. I had many other options: Placement jobs, local consultancies, applying for Master in Engineering (M.E.); but I thought to myself, what among all this is the thing I really want to do. Finally, after discussing the same with family and friends, I decided to give content writing a shot. I had written a few decent answers on Quora already, and that was the only confidence booster I had. On 3rd June, I joined the office of WittyFeed. And that has been the best decision of my life.

It's been almost three months here, and in all this time, I've learnt a lot. Everyday I get to learn something new here. I work as a content writer here but I've also learnt a lot about business, marketing strategies, SEO traffic, etc. in less than three months. I've stepped into fiction writing too. Heck, I even started my personal Facebook page which is getting good response from people. I receive messages from all over the world appreciating my writing skills and wish me the best for future. More than 35 percent of my story viewers come from USA, 20 percent from UK and 10 percent from Australia. My writings are going global now. Wow!

The biggest change that came though, was that I stopped being the architect of my life. I became a person who lives in the moment. I don't know for how long I'll be working here; I also don't know what I would be doing after five years, all because I don't wanna know. I'm pretty happy and blessed with my life and the people in it, and I'm ready to go wherever my life takes me. 

Had I cleared the exam with flying colors, I wouldn't have earned the chance to explore my life, listen to my life and nurture my hobbies to a professional level. Everything happens for a good reason, and a small six-month failure saved me from a huge failure of a lifetime.</h5></pre>
