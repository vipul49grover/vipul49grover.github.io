		<h5>
My mother had been a cancer patient. It was cured initially but relapsed after an year with a much worse form. Metastasis that had reached her bones and was proceeding towards her brain. And she expired in front of my eyes, multiple organ failure.

My mother had been a constant motivator in my life. My academic achievements in my entire life (and years to come) are because of her efforts. Right from my birth, she had invested in me all her good qualities. Her departure instilled in me a sense of responsibility towards my younger sister who is fortunate enough to get experiences of her elder sister but not the presence and well-being of her mother. 

I was with the task of taking care of my father as well. I had learned to keep a family together. My father is quite young and has a lot of life ahead. It was not a very happy sight to see him doing the daily chores of house, right from putting tiffin for my sister at 5:30 in morning (while I was away at college), to collect all the dry clothes after washing and instructing the maid for the food to be cooked. It was heart aching. He should be there working and not spending 75% of his time looking after house issues. However he did that with no qualms at all.

So, when my relatives came up with the idea of remarriage, I totally supported it. Well, generally we become possessive of our father and siblings after the demise of a blood relation, but sometimes for the GREATER GOOD, things have to be put aside. 

Fortunately we got a lady who was a widow, with no children of the same age as of my father and with no intention of kids in future. This was a blessing. Then at that moment, I had the task of making my sister understand the need of the hour. My sister, who matured earlier than her age, fully supported it too after little bit of convincing.

My father got married and now we are still a family. But somehow, the death and my father's remarriage, changed my perspective towards everything. How life is uncertain. How sometimes, you have to give up on your love for someone else's well being. For a better future, how you have to think well ahead of time. How you should value what you have instead of cribbing everytime cause its true, you understand the worth of a thing when its gone. 

It made me more mature. More emotionally stable. More rational. and a better person.</h5></pre>
