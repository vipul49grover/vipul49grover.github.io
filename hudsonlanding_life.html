I remember the entire occasion like it was yesterday and always will. It all started when my wife gave me a ride to the airport. I gave my wife a kiss, said "I love you babe", got out, grabbed my heavy luggage, and walked into the airport.

Before I continue, let's make one thing straight. Many people ask me if I had a bad feeling before the flight. No. Not at all; I didn't think twice about it. I'm a lawyer for Christ's sake! I fly about twice a month! The people who do say they had a bad feeling probably had too much caffeine. 

Now back to the airport: after checking my luggage in, I made my way through security, got on the plane, and sat down, first class. 

I leaned back, buckled up, and waited for take off. After a couple minutes, I heard the low roar of the engine behind/underneath me. The plane slowly moved forward, and then positioned itself to take off.  The engines got louder, and I felt the acceleration increase... Faster....and faster... And pretty soon, I felt my seat lean back. Everything was typical; and I was sitting third row beside the window. For about a minute, it was rather boring.... I was thinking about my clients,... And evidence....and then my wife.....

Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr POP-POP-POP!!!! 

 WHAT THE FUCK?  I thought. 
THE ENGINE WENT QUIET.


 I sat up, doing the catholic cross with my right hand and calling my wife the other. Why call my wife? Instinct, I'd say. Every time something goes wrong, I call my wife. It makes everything better. 
And then the plane dipped forward. 
And there I was, calling my wife. It rang twice, and right when she picked up, the pilot got on the intercom and said, 
"This is the captain, brace for impact". 
Shaking, I said to my wife,
"I love you, tell Olivia that". 
Note: Olivia is my daughter, she was 12 at the time. My wife exclaimed,
"What's wrong? Honey are you ok?" 
I hung up. 

It was too much for me. I almost knew for sure I would die. To hear my wife's voice was more than enough for me. I sat forward, gripping the first class leather.... And that's all I can remember. 


The impact temporary knocked me out; I later woke up in a boat, thanking God to be alive. 

Don't take life for granted, neither the people you love. 
There isn't a price that could repay the pilot; he saved 155 lives, including mine.s</h5></pre>
