		<h5>This may seem like a joke, but it really does make a lot of sense... business sense, horse sense and common sense ~~~~

An old Native American wanted a loan for $500.  

The banker pulled out the loan application. 
"What are you going to do with the money?" he asks the Indian.

"Buy Silver, make jewelry, and sell it," was the response.

"What have you got for collateral?"

"Don't know collateral," replied the Indian

"Well that's something of value that would cover the cost of the loan.  
"Have you got any vehicles?"

"Yes.  1949 Chevy pickup," replied the Indian

The banker shook his head, "How about livestock?"

"Yes, I have a horse," replied the Indian

"How old is it?" the banker asks.

"Don't know, has no teeth," replies the Indian

Finally the banker decided to make the $500 loan.

Several weeks later the old man was back in the bank.  
He pulled out a roll of bills, "Here to pay." he said.  
He then handed the banker the money to pay his loan off.

"What are you going to do with the rest of that money?" the banker asks.

"Put in hogan", replied the Indian

"Why don't you deposit it in my bank," the banker asked.

"Don't know deposit," replied the Indian

"You put the money in our bank and we take care of it for you.  
Whenever you want to use it, you can withdraw it."

The old Indian leaned across the desk and asks the banker... 
"What you got for collateral?"</h5></pre>
